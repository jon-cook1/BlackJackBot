Notes:

For now we are giving basic rules to the player:
    - Stand on 21 and 20
    - Always hit if value is less than 12

Dealer:
    - Always stand 17, hard or soft, can be changed

Both:
    - Have a third return boolean representing whether the game is over or not (player/ dealer bust)
        - Might need to add this as a parameter, keeping it as a return value though as I'm predicting it will be useful later
